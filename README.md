# Flutter Conference app

`Flutter Conference app` (what a name) is a project that lets you build your own version of the app for a conference.

Because it's in flutter, you can build versions of your app for both Android and iOS respectively!


## Features
- Modern, colorful, engaging design
- Smooth animations
- Customize your colors, logo and background
- JSON customization: no need to touch the code!
- Remote sync: modify the JSON config file and the app automatically syncs changes
